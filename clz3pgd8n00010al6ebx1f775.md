*These are only my personal notes about the book "Who Moved My Cheese?" by Dr. Spencer Johnson. Things that are important to me may not be as significant to you, and vice versa. If you are interested in the book you can buy your copy* [*here*](https://www.amazon.com/Who-Moved-My-Cheese-Mazing-ebook/dp/B004CR6AM4)*.*

This book is a short fable about four characters - two mice named Sniff and Scurry, and two tiny humans named Hem and Haw - who live in a maze and search for cheese, which symbolizes happiness and success. When the cheese they rely on is moved, the mice quickly adapt and search for new cheese, while Hem and Haw resist the change. Eventually, Haw learns to embrace change and finds new cheese, realizing that adapting to change leads to new opportunities and happiness.

These are the sentences important to me:

* We keep doing the same things over and over again and wonder why things don't get better.
    
* Sometimes things change and they are never the same again. That's life! Life moves on. And so should we.
    
* What would you do if you weren't afraid?
    
* When you stop being afraid, you feel good!
    
* Imagining yourself enjoying your new cheese leads you to it.
    
* The quicker you let go of old cheese, the sooner you find new cheese.
    
* Noticing small changes early helps you adapt to the bigger changes that are to come.
    
* Envision yourself in realistic detail finding something better.
    
* Reflect on the mistakes you made in the past and use them to plan your future.
    
* You could be more aware of the need to keep things simple, be flexible, and move quickly.
    
* Always stay in touch with what is happening around you, don't isolate yourself in your confort zone.
    

*My rating:* ★★☆☆☆
